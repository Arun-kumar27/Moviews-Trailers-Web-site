Movies Trailers Website is a responsive and dynamic web application built using React.js.
The platform allows users to explore trending and popular movies trailers, view details such as movie posters, descriptions, ratings, and watch official trailers.
The application fetches real-time data from a Movies API (e.g., TMDB API) and presents it in an engaging UI.
It includes search functionality so users can find movies by title, and each movie card leads to a detailed page with trailer integration (via YouTube embed or API).
